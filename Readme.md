# Conventions [![Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/Jamesking56/Conventions.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/Jamesking56/Conventions)
This repository is built for documentation only. It shows my programming best practices and coding conventions which I will adhere to in my own personal projects and freelance client based projects.

Feel free to take a look through the Markdown formatted files and learn from my coding practices.

I've chosen to make my own practices because there are some points in popular conventions out there which I don't agree with and therefore wanted my own to stick to.

Please see [Contributing.md](https://github.com/Jamesking56/Conventions/blob/master/Contributing.md) if you wish to suggest your own conventions.
