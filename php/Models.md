# Models
All Models must follow these conventions if possible:

* Name must be Singular form of data (e.g. User for the users table)
* If using a database, the table must have an id field.
* Must use Foreign Keys wherever possible (Referential Integrity).
* Must use Eloquent models wherever possible.
